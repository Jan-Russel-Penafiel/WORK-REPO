Getting Started with MERN Stack
There are two requirements to start a MERN stack project:

Step 1: Install node on your system depending on your Operating System:

Installation of NodeJS on Windows
Installation of NodeJS on Linux
Step 2: You need a code editor to work with so install a code editor, preferably we will use VS Code

Setting Up a MERN Stack Project
To setup MERN stack we need to create a folder structure for both frontend and backend. Then we have to define database schema to store and retrieve data from the database.

Follow the below steps to create a basic structure

Step 1: After the code editor is installed, create a new project folder. Then go to the project folder in command prompt/terminal and type below commands to create folder for frontend and backend 

mkdir frontend
mkdir backend
Step 2: Navigate to the frontend folder using the command

cd frontend
Step 3: Initialize a React Project using the command

npx create-react-app
Step 4: Now navigate to the backend folder using the command

cd..
cd backend
Step 5: Initialize the project backend using the command

npm init -y
Step 6: Install Express and other backend dependencies using the command

npm i mongodb express cors dotenv
